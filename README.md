# Emergency Ambulance Booking

## Project Overview

Emergency Ambulance Booking is a web application designed to provide a seamless experience for booking ambulance services in emergency situations. The application offers features such as a booking form, confirmation page, and an admin dashboard for managing ambulance bookings. Built using HTML, CSS (tailwind), and JavaScript, it aims to ensure quick access to emergency medical services.

## Installation

To get started with the Emergency Ambulance Booking application locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/emergency-ambulance-booking.git
   cd emergency-ambulance-booking
   ```

2. **Open the project files in your preferred code editor.**

3. **Open `index.html` in your web browser to view the application.**

4. **For any backend functionality or APIs, additional setup may be required.**

No additional software installation is needed aside from a web browser since the project is front-end only.

## Usage

1. **Home Page:** Start by visiting the home page, where you can find information about the ambulance service and a button to book an ambulance.

2. **Booking Page:** Fill out the ambulance booking form by providing necessary patient information, including:
   - Patient's Full Name
   - Contact Number
   - Type of Emergency
   - Pickup Location
   - Additional Notes (optional)

3. **Confirm Booking:** After submitting the form, you will be redirected to a confirmation page that details the booking, including the Booking ID and estimated arrival time.

4. **Admin Page:** The admin dashboard allows managing all ambulance bookings, displaying current booking statuses, and total bookings.

## Features

- **24/7 Availability:** Book ambulance services any time, day or night.
- **Fast Response:** Quick access to emergency medical assistance.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Intuitive design for easy navigation.
